=== Adding Custom Root Certification Authority

In corporate networks tested environments are often using self-signed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security[TLS] certificates. Such certificates are issued by a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate[root certification authority] not known to browsers. When trying to open an HTTPS web-page using a self-signed certificate, your browser by default will refuse to do this saying that "Your connection is not private" or "This connection is untrusted". In Selenium tests you can use a standard capability (`acceptInsecureCerts = true`) to ignore such certificate errors but this will not work when your web-page is using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security[HSTS].

In order to work properly with self-signed certificates, you have to add your root certification authority certificate to a list of trusted certificates. Our images allow to do this using environment variables. For every root certificate stored in `cert.pem` file:

. Encode `cert.pem` file contents to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64[Base64]:

    CERT_CONTENTS=$(cat cert.pem | base64 -w0)

+
In case of MacOS respective command would be:

    CERT_CONTENTS=$(cat cert.pem | base64)

. Set an environment variable to browser image:

    ROOT_CA_<cert-name>="$CERT_CONTENTS"

+
In that case `<cert-name>` will be used as certificate name in the browser certificates storage. For example:

    ROOT_CA_MY_CERT="LS0tL....=="

=== Using Custom Browser Profile with Chrome

If launching Chrome with a custom profile directory, Devtools will not work unless you
also set the `BROWSER_PROFILE_DIR` environment variable. _E.g._ when requesting the session:

[source,json]
----
{
  "capabilities": {
    "alwaysMatch": {
      "browserName": "chrome",
      "browserVersion": "114.0",
      "goog:chromeOptions": {
        "args": [ "user-data-dir=/profiles/custom.XYZ" ]
      },
      "selenoid:options": {
        "env": [ "BROWSER_PROFILE_DIR=/profiles/custom.XYZ" ]
      }
    }
  }
}
